# About Me

This project is a simple **HTML-only About Me webpage** created to practice foundational web development concepts, including semantic HTML, accessibility, and clean content structure.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The About Me page introduces who I am, my interests, and ways to connect with me online. The focus of this project is on:

- Writing clear, semantic HTML
- Using accessible markup
- Structuring content in a readable, user-friendly way
- Avoiding external libraries or CSS frameworks

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5

> This project intentionally uses **HTML only** — no CSS, JavaScript, or external libraries.

## ♿ Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility was a key part of this project. Efforts include:

- Semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- Descriptive link text (e.g., “my rescue dogs” instead of “click here”)
- `alt` attributes for images
- Text included alongside icons and emojis for screen reader support

## 📌 Features

- About Me section with personal interests
- Clickable links to external profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Text links that open images
- Emoji icons used as visual enhancements

## 📷 Example Content

Some links on the page open images, such as a photo of my rescue dogs, to demonstrate linking text to media using HTML.
