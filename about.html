            <p>
                I'm a software development student with a background in technical support,
                creative design, and hands-on problems solving. I enjoy building clean,
                accessible web pages and learning how different technologies work together.
            </p>

            <p> I've completed an intensive coding program where I gained valuable experience with full-stack 
                development. I continue to build my skills through hands-on projects and practice, especially
                projects that blend logic, creativity, and usability.
            </p>

            <p>In my free time, I love to explore new design trends, work on personal coding projects,
                and connect with other developers in the community. I'm passionate about continuous learning
                and excited to see where my journey in web development takes me.
            </p>
